# Vimmy - Neato Vim-ness for Safari

## Commands
- `hjkl` to scroll left/down/up/right
- `gg` and `shift+g` to scroll to top/bottom
- `f` to click on elements like links, inputs, buttons
- `shift-f` to open links in a new background tab
- `esc` and `ctrl+[` to break out of link mode

## Why

There are other Vim extensions for Safari, but this one is mine!

- better hints (high contrast, chevrons show associated link)
- fluid scrolling animations
- minimum useful command set
