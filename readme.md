# Vimmy - Neato Vim-ness for Safari

## Commands
- `hjkl` to scroll left/down/up/right
- `gg` and `shift+g` to scroll to top/bottom
- `f` to follow a link with its default action
- `shift-f` to follow a link in a new tab
- `esc` and `ctrl+[` to break out of link mode

## Why

- better hints (high contrast, chevrons show associated link)
- fluid scrolling animations
- minimum useful command set
- allows for ignoring websites with their own HJKL navigation
